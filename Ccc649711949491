Validation

Example of PHP Code for Validating Credit Cards

Author: Angelina Briggs

Is it feasible to enclose HTML form components with multiple form tags? It is not possible to separate the quantity into a separate form and include it with the other elements in the other form.

Credit card date validation with respect to current date PHP JavaScript
Solution 1:

Utilize the date object in JavaScript, as an illustration.

var currentDate = new Date(); //this returns the current datetime
//Clear all the other date parts.
currentDate.setDate(0);
currentDate.setHours(0);
currentDate.setMinutes(0);
currentDate.setSeconds(0);
currentDate.setMilliseconds(0);
var year = 2013;
var month = 6;
//I hardcode year and month (you get year and month from user)
var dateToCheck = new Date(year,month,0,0,0,0,0);
// Check like this:
if (dateToCheck.getTime() < currentDate.getTime()){
   //invalid date
}
To modify your code, simply include one additional "if" statement. For example:

  function validate(payment_form){
       if(payment_form.credit_card_exp.value.length==0){
           document.getElementById("credit_card_exp_error").innerHTML="Enter Credit Card Expiry Date";
           return false;
       }
       var datereg = /^(0[1-9]|1[012])[- /.](19|20)\d\d+$/;
       if (!datereg.test(payment_form.credit_card_exp.value)) {
           document.getElementById("credit_card_exp_error").innerHTML="Enter valid Date";
           return false;
        }
        var currentDate = new Date(); //this returns the current datetime
        //Clear all the other date parts.
        currentDate.setDate(0);
        currentDate.setHours(0);
        currentDate.setMinutes(0);
        currentDate.setSeconds(0);
        currentDate.setMilliseconds(0);   
        var year = parseInt(payment_form.credit_card_exp.value.split('/')[1]);
        var month = parseInt(payment_form.credit_card_exp.value.split('/')[0]);
        var dateToCheck = new Date(year,month,0,0,0,0,0);
        if (dateToCheck.getTime() < currentDate.getTime()){
           //invalid date
            return false;
        } 
        document.getElementById("credit_card_exp_error").innerHTML="";
        return true; 
  }

Solution 2:



If you opt for jQuery validation, you can apply it to the mm/yy pattern, which can be conveniently adapted for the mm/yyyy format.

$.validator.addMethod("card_expiry", function (value, element) {
return checkExpire(value);}, "Invalid expiry date");
function checkExpire(value) {
    var today = new Date();
    var year = value.substring(value.indexOf('/') + 1, 5);
    var month = value.substring(0, value.indexOf('/'));
    var expDate = new Date('20' + year, (month)); // JS Date Month is 0-11 not 1-12 replace parameters with year and month
    if (parseInt(month) > 12) {
        return false;
    } else if (today.getTime() > expDate.getTime()) {
    return false;
    } else if (/^((0[1-9])|(1[0-2]))\/(\d{2})$/i.test(value) == false) {
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}
Assign the class card_expiry to your element.

Html - Credit card date validation with respect to current, For example, if you type 05/2013, the code below accepts it and submits the form, but logically the date 05/2013 has expired so it should show a message saying that the credit card date expired. In other words validation should pass with current or future dates, but not past ones.
Credit Card Validation and send over mail

Solution:

To receive transaction data from a third-party service, such as Stripe, you must utilize the available webhooks. These webhooks allow for the transmission of JSON-formatted data to a specified URL. Once received, this data can be utilized to send emails. For further information, refer to: https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks.

Please be aware that the third-party services will only provide you with the last four digits of the credit card number and the expiration date, but not the full credit card number.

Php validate phone number with nigeria country code, $phone = '000-0000-0000'; if(preg_match("/^[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{4}$/", $phone)) { // $phone is valid }
Is this credit card validation is valid
Solution:

Utilizing regular expressions is my recommendation. To ensure the validation of Visa, Mastercard, Discovery, American Express, and the security code, feel free to check out the code snippet I have included in my repository.

The RegexCollection repository can be found at the following link: https://github.com/leojavier/RegexCollection

Keep in mind that restricting the number of digits does not guarantee correctness.

To illustrate, Visa card numbers always begin with the digit 4 and consist of 16 digits. Meanwhile, MasterCard numbers consistently start with numbers 51 through 55 and also comprise 16 digits.

The index.html serves as an example that demonstrates how you can make use of it. Don't hesitate to contact me if you need any clarification.

Php validate mail Code Example, //BE CAREFUL!!! //NEVER VALIDATE A EMAIL WITH A NORMAL PREG MATCH //I SAW THIS A LOT VALIDATING A EMAIL IS THE BEST TO SEND A EMAIL //AND VERIFY //BECAUSE SOMEONE MIGHT HAVE A RIGHT EMAIL THAT DOESNT WORK BECAUSE OF //PREG MATCH
My PHP credit card form not recognizing certain inputs and errors
Solution 1:



This:


The way in which the  <button>  element is created is not the issue. It seems that you have tried to modify an  <input />  element. To achieve your desired outcome, this is probably what you need to do:

Checkout
It seems that you have copied the  id  on two forms, which is not allowed. You need to either remove the  id  from the form that contains the submit button or replace it with a different code.


Solution 2:

It appears to me that there are multiple questions at hand. Given their number, there is a possibility of confusion. Please let me know if I make any obvious errors.

Regarding the "amount" box, it would be beneficial if it could detect whether it is empty or has been filled.

You cannot separate the amount and add it to another form element. All the content that you wish to post must be included in the same form element, unless you decide to use the html5 form attribute. However, it is unclear whether IE supports this feature. Even if it does, adding more form elements is not possible. For further information, please refer to the comments in the accepted answer of the question "Is it possible to wrap html form elements in multiple form tags?".

Concerning the boxes remaining unchanged despite errors.

>Suite/Apt #
Should probably be:

>Suite/Apt #
The errors array's keys should be searched by your in_array since your array is keyed with the element names. Please note that the class-setting code should be applied to the boxes if you want to change the boxes themselves rather than just the labels colors.

Another answer provides information on how to address the button.

Checkout
It's uncertain whether IE supports HTML5 outside of a form element. However, if you're targeting browsers that support the form attribute, you don't have to enclose it within a form element.

Checkout
Inside form.
